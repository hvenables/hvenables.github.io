				<p>With the Pre-Course nearly over, I have decided to start a blog to track my progress through what will probably be the most intense three months of my life.</p>

<p>The Pre course began almost 4 weeks ago. We started with learning about command line and the unix system,</p>

<p>which is how to interact with computers without a graphically interface. This gets you thinking about computers in a completely different way as it is a completely different way to interact with them. This then led on to our second week learning and understanding the git version control software.</p> <center><img src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/modules/logos_page/Octocat.png" width="300px"> </center>  
<p>I felt all good so far! Then came the real aim of our pre course and that is to learn the programming language of Ruby!</p>

<p>I had already had an idea that this would be one of the hardest parts of the pre course not just because it is the largest topic we would cover but by what the seniors had said when we went for our induction 4 weeks ago. The phrase that sticks in my mind is being told that i wont be learning ruby when i get there but using it so you need to learn as much now as you can! So that is what i have been striving to do... only time will tell if i have done enough.</p>

<p>I will keep people updated weekly with my progress, All i can say is that i cant wait for Tuesday and my new life to begin!</p>
